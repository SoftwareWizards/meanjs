      <h1>You Should Join Us</h1><br>
      <p class="lead">

        Sign up to become a Builder or a Climber and join a growing community of individuals trying to better themselves and make the world a better place.

      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>How It Works </h1>
      <br>

      <p class="highlight">1. Sign up as either a Builder or Climber.</p>
      <p>If you want to complete tasks, then sign up as a Climber.</p>
      <p>If you want to post tasks to be completed, sign up as a Builder!</p>
      <p class="highlight">2. Create, View, & Select Tasks</p>
      <p>A builder will create tasks and then track progress.</p>
      <p>A climber will browse and select tasks to complete.</p>
      <p class="highlight">3. Track Progress</p>
      <p>Builders can view any updates to their task progress.</p>
      <p>Climbers can upload files and add notes to give progress updates</p>
      <p class="highlight">4. Pay or Get Paid</p>
      <p>Upon completion of a task, the climber will be compensated in the form they choose</p>

      <h1> Builders </h1>
      <p>As a Builder, you are responsible for creating opportunities where
        were none previously. Whether you want to have audio transcribed,
        have someone cook in your restaurant, go grocery shopping for a senior citizen,
        or anything in between, no task is too small.</p>

      <h1> Climbers </h1>
      <p>As a climber, you can hop around to different fields and try out different tasks to see what you like. This will also give you experience in the field. You are one step closer to finding a job and a little bit richer too!</p>
