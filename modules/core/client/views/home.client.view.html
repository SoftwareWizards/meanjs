      <h1> Builders </h1>
      <p>As a Builder, you are responsible for creating opportunities where
        there were none previously. Whether you want to have audio transcribed,
        have someone cook in your restaurant, go grocery shopping for a senior citizen,
        or anything in between, no task is too small.</p>

      <h1> Climbers </h1>
      <p>As a climber, you can hop around to different fields and try out different tasks to see what you like. This will also give you experience in the field. You are one step closer to finding a job and a little bit richer too!</p>
